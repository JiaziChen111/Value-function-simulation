1. LICENSE AGREEMENT.

2. The article “Solving Nonlinear Stochastic Growth Models: Iterating on 
Value Function by Simulations” by Lilia Maliar and Serguei Maliar, (2005), 
Economics Letters 87, 135-140 (a working paper version). 

3. MATLAB FILES.

   a. "OneSector.m" and "TwoSector.m" are programs that solve the one- 
      and two-sector models, respectively;

   b. "objective.m" is the objective function shared by both OneSector.m 
       and TwoSector.m programms;

   c. "shock.m" defines the parameters of exogenous shocks, creates 
       simulated series for such shocks and saves them on the disc; 

   d. "shock005" and "shock05" are outputs of the program "shock.m" 
       corresponding to the values 0.005 and 0.05 of the standard 
       deviations of the error term, respectively. The realizations 
      "shock005" and "shock05" were used to compute the results in 
       the paper.
